This code is unique for this product and matches the user name you specify  when ordering. Usually this message is sent shortly after purchase to the e-mail  address you specified when ordering.<br />  Please save or print your registration information for future reference.</p><p>If you buy BOOM using the built-in order form (see <a href="help:anchor='purchasing' bookID=BOOM Help">&quot;Purchasing    BOOM&quot;</a>), the application receives the registration information directly    from the order processing system. The registration code is installed automatically    and the game is unlocked instantly! No action is required on your part to    register the game.</p><p>If you buy BOOM online, you need to complete the registration process and  unlock your copy of the program manually.<br />  To do so, you have to enter your registration information in the program's  registration dialog.<br />  To open the registration dialog, launch the program and click on the &quot;Register...&quot; button  in the Shareware Reminder dialog. You can also select the corresponding item  from the Application menu.</p><p>Both name and code must be typed EXACTLY as reported in the purchase confirmation  message.<br />  If your code is rejected, try again. Use copy &amp; paste to avoid errors.  If the problem persists, contact me for help (see <a href="help:anchor='contact' bookID=BOOM Help">&quot;Contact  info&quot;</a>).</p><hr /><div id="footer">  <p><a href="help:anchor='home' bookID=BOOM Help"><strong>BOOM        Help Home</strong></a></p>  <p>&copy; 1997-2011 <a href="http://www.factor-software.com/">Factor Software</a>.    All Rights Reserved.</p></div></body></html>
