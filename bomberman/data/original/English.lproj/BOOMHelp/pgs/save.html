Saved games can be eliminated by using the delete button (-) in the &quot;open  game&quot; dialog.<br />  The files corresponding to deleted games are actually moved to the Trash so  that you can recover them in case you change your mind.</p><p>To recover a deleted saved game file, move it out of the Trash and double  click on it directly in the Finder to open it in BOOM. Once the game has started,  you can save it again.</p><hr /><div id="footer">  <p><a href="help:anchor='home' bookID=BOOM Help"><strong>BOOM        Help Home</strong></a></p>  <p>&copy; 1997-2011 <a href="http://www.factor-software.com/">Factor Software</a>.    All Rights Reserved.</p></div></body></html>
